## Discontinuation Notice
Since I have lack of motivation to continue this map combo,  unfortunately Adventurer's Combo project will be discontinued starting with 1.48 update. From now on I recommend you migrating to [GMC Logistic's Map Combo](https://www.gmc-logistics.co.uk/) since it has easier installation of map combo and you can select the mod you want to use.

## Adventurer's Combo
> For those who wish to explore around the world.

Adventurer's Combo is the project for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator which keeps everything simple while allowing you to travel around the world without getting you bored.
